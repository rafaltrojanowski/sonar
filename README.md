# Sonar

Data visialization app, that shows ocean depth in meters for particular locations.

Inspired by: https://github.com/Chris78/sl2decode

Use sl2decode to retrieve data in csv format.

TODO:

- Add CSV Import and listing data
- Data visualization (map?)
- Add direct import from SL2 (decode files)
- Prevent duplicated entries in database
